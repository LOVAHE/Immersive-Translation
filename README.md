# Immersive-Translation
A simple browser translation extension

This is a very simple browser translation extension that provides an experience similar to immersive translation. It supports both full-page translation and translating selected text (word/phrase highlighting).

It supports Firefox or Chrome browsers (Note: Different Background.js files are required depending on the browser; please see code).

Currently, it supports using ~~Large Language Models (LLM) and~~ Azure Translator API.

If you have requirements for other APIs, feel free to submit issues or pull requests (Thank you!).
